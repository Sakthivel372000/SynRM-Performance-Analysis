# SynRM Performance Analysis                                                       
*Description:* 
>This project focuses on the key notions about analysis and design of synchronous reluctance motors. The aim is to highlight not only the advantages of such machines but also some drawbacks such as the low power factor and the torque ripple in SynRM.
This machine is widely being compared with induction machine and it is also being replaced for PMSM in electric vehicles due to its high torque  and improved performance for the same rating compared to the other two and also it is permanent magnet free. 
Nameplate details for SynRM and induction machine were obtained from Danfoss lab ,PSG college of technology for our design.This project mainly focus on modelling a  SynRM for industrial applications and to compare different  models of SynRM  to check which one produces  high power factor and low torque ripple. 
             As a part  of this project induction motor with same rating was modelled first. 
The induction motor was designed for same rating after that its stator part  was kept fixed and rotor design alone was changed to model SynRM.
SynRM works on Reluctance torque principle , in order to have better torque the flux flow around the d axis of the machine must be increased and q axis flux flow must be reduced .  To achive such a design the geometry of the rotor must be changed. SynRM rotor with four different configurations by varying the no of flux barriers were modelled and analysed. SynRM has low power factor compared to induction machine of same rating. So, power factor improvement strategies in SynRM were analysed.
Relation between power factor, torque and current angle was analysed and torque and power factor   as a function of current angle were plotted. The operating point at which maximum power factor is achieved and relation between no of flux barriers and power factor were plotted and justifed . Relation between torque ripple and current angle were analysed and torque  ripple as a function of current angle was plotted and the operating at which least torque ripple occurs for the design was plotted .
